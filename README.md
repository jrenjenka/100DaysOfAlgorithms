# Technical Interview Preparation Plan
## Part 1: Learn data structures and algorithms from scratch 
**Time:** 3 months 
### How To: 
1. Data structure: take notes, draw concepts
2. Algorithms for this data structure: take notes, draw concepts
3. Implement data structure and its algorithms from scratch
4. Solve 3 problems on LeetCode: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard

**Implementation routine:**
1. Read problem specification
2. Write unit tests: corner cases, general usage, stress test
3. Design problem solution
4. Write code in IDE
5. Test it
