# Algorithms_and_Data_Structures
**Goal**: learn algorithms and data structures and prepare for a technical interview;

**Resources**:

*Theory*:
1. [Princeton Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
2. [Princeton Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
3. [Dr. Rob Edwards from San Diego State University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgCnMvvw6Oo&list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk)
4. [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jrenjenka/coding-interview-university)

*Practice*:
1. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/)
2. [InterviewBit Programming Track](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)

**Daily plan**:

2 hours: solving problems;

1 hour: watching lectures;


Once a week review theory notes
