# Algorithms_and_Data_Structures
Goal: getting good algorithmic skills both theoretical and practical.

Challenge: 100 days of learning algorithms

I'm primarily doing [Data Structures and Algorithms specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms? "Data Structures and Algorithms") on Coursera from UCSD. I won't publish my solutions to problem assignments because it violates [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code "Cousera Honor Code") but I want to check my progress.
